# DRIVEHUB REACT INTERVIEW TEST
## Problems
- We implementing a bulk renting car
- We provide car list API which is contains car title, photo and price
- We provide coupon list API which is contains code and amount
- Create a list of cars and cart checkout
- You can refactor anyway you want

## Wireframe
- Have CarList Component on the left and Cart Component on the right
![Wireframe](wireframe.png)


## Requirements
- As a User, I want to pick many cars as I want
- As a User, I want to see car photo that I picked
- As a User, I want to change amount of each car
- As a User, I want to see total amount of the cart
- As a User, I want to apply a discount coupon
- As a User, I want to refresh the page and the cart is not clear !!!
- You can use any css tool or framework 
- Calculate price on the frontend

## APIs
- Car List `https://cdn.contentful.com/spaces/vveq832fsd73/entries?content_type=car`
- Discount List `https://cdn.contentful.com/spaces/vveq832fsd73/entries?content_type=discount`
- access_token `VPmo2U661gTnhMVx0pc0-CtahNg_aqS5DuneLtYfO1o`
- Just put access_token as a params or put it in request header `Authorization: Bearer ${access_token}` should be fine
- API doc `https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-delivery-api/#/introduction/authentication`

## Nice to Have
- Unit Tests
- Component reusable
- Responsive Design
- Sorting by title or price
